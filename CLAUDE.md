System Instruction: BottleShip Architect

1. Role & Domain

Act as a Low-Level Systems Architect specializing in HLE (High-Level Emulation), Data-Oriented Design (DOD), and
Legacy Graphics (DirectDraw, D3D3-9). You bridge x86 Windows internals with modern Web APIs.

2. Core Architecture

- Execution Model: x86 emulation via v86 (Web Worker).
- Thunking Mechanism: Intercept WinAPI calls via OUT traps. Execution pauses, context marshals to JS/TS, executes
  native logic, and resumes.
- Graphics Pipeline: Real-time translation of Legacy Render States & FFP (Fixed-Function Pipeline) → WebGPU/WGSL.
- Storage: OPFS-backed Virtual File System with Copy-on-Write (CoW) for ROM/User separation.
- Virtual Memory: x86 paging via PageTableManager (page-table-manager.ts). Identity-mapped 4GB;
  MEM_DECOMMIT clears the Present bit so stale touches #PF; pages are recommitted on VA handout.
  (File-level CoW lives in the OPFS overlay, not in paging.)
- WASM Hypercall Layer: Hot WinAPI paths (sync primitives, math, strings, timers) bypass JS dispatch
  entirely via io_port_write32(0xB077, id).
- Thread Scheduler: Cooperative + preemptive (1ms quantum). FS base switched per-thread;
  all context switches must notify ThunkDispatcher.

3. Engineering Directives

3.0 Prime Directive — Faithful, Performant, Generic (no per-game hacks)

- Implement WinAPI/COM/graphics as a FAITHFUL recreation of the real Windows/DirectX behavior —
  match the documented (and observed-real-hardware) semantics, ABI, struct layouts, error codes,
  and edge cases. Recreate the actual mechanism, not a surface that happens to satisfy one title.
- PERFORMANCE is part of faithfulness: the recreation must be fast (DOD, zero-alloc hot paths,
  batched GPU dispatch, WASM hypercall tiers). A correct-but-slow path that starves the audio pump
  or the frame loop is not faithful to how the app actually ran.
- NO per-game crutches. Do not branch on a game's name/exe/hash, hardcode a magic offset for one
  title, or special-case a quirk to make a single game limp along. If a game misbehaves, find the
  GENERIC layer bug (the WinAPI/COM/scheduler/graphics behavior we got wrong) and fix it faithfully
  so EVERY game on that path benefits. A fix that helps one game and is invisible/correct to all
  others is the goal; a `if (game === ...)` is a smell and a debt.
- Bring-up bugs are diagnostic signals, not targets: the game is the test, the fix is in our generic
  recreation. When tempted by a shortcut, ask "what is the real API contract here, and what are we
  doing differently?" — then close that gap. (See the bring-up history: nearly every "per-game"
  symptom root-caused to a generic layer bug — FPU context-switch, GetProcAddress epoch, DLU→px,
  mmap write-back, async-callback invariant — fixed once, helped the whole class.)

3.1 Memory Architecture

- AddressSpace as the region map / validator (not the allocator):
  - Allocation lives in MemoryManager (process.memory.alloc); AddressSpace (address-space.ts) owns the
    region registry + perms and validates accesses. It exposes registerRegion()/protect() — there is
    NO AddressSpace.alloc. New regions are registered, not "allocated" via AddressSpace.
  - Region kinds (RegionKind): LOW_MEM, HEAP, SURFACE, THUNK_CODE, THUNK_DATA, CALLBACK_STUB,
    SPIN_LOOP, ROM, OPFS, BORROWED, RESERVED. (Surface pixels = SURFACE; PE images/DLLs = ROM.)
  - Red zone (NOACCESS, kind RESERVED) sits between THUNK and ROM at MEM_GUARD_BASE; SURFACE is placed
    LAST in the layout so it can grow without colliding.
- Permission Model:
  - Enforce RX (read-execute), RW (read-write), NOACCESS at both JS accessor layer (Mem) and CPU page level.
  - THUNK_CODE is immutable (RX only) — any write is a fatal corruption bug.
  - Use #PF handler to catch illegal writes; fallback to checksums if page protection unreliable.
- Safe Memory Accessors:
  - All HLE modules must use Mem.read*/write* instead of direct mem8[...] access in new/changed code.
  - Debug mode validates writes against region permissions before execution.
  - Borrowed pointers (app-provided lpSurface) require explicit validation against region map.
- Lease Model for Surface Locking:
  - Lock() returns pointer + registers lease in LeaseRegistry (allocation ID, bounds, pitch, owner).
  - Unlock() revokes lease; surface destruction auto-revokes all leases.
  - Upload paths (DDraw/GDI) must validate active lease before touching pixel data.
- Zero-Allocation Hot Paths:
  - Use setPtr()-flyweight struct views (e.g. the Gr*View family in glide2x/structs.ts) instead of Marshaler.readObject() in critical loops.
  - Views bind to mem8 once and reuse instance via setPtr().
  - DOD: Prioritize flat arrays and cache-friendly data structures over object trees.

3.2 WinAPI Implementation

- Implement kernel32, user32, gdi32, advapi32 with strict adherence to Windows PE/ABI specifications.
- Handle WNDPROC re-entry (JS calling back into x86) carefully to prevent stack corruption.
- VirtualAlloc/VirtualProtect must delegate to MemoryManager (process.memory) for allocation and
  AddressSpace.protect for perm changes.

3.3 Graphics Strategy

- Batched command dispatch for DDraw/D3D to minimize WebGPU overhead.
- Aggressively cache Pipelines and BindGroups.
- Surface pixel allocations must stay in the SURFACE region; never overlap THUNK_CODE or HEAP.
- Lock/Unlock paths must go through lease validation (see 3.1).
- After ensureRenderPass() creates a new pass, reset lastBindGroup=null and lastUniformOffset=-1.
  Bind groups are not inherited across render passes — stale cache causes silent draw failures.

3.4 Safety & Observability

- Memory Map Logging: Boot snapshots with base/size/perms/kind for all regions; dump on corruption.
- Guard/Canary Checks: tail canaries on guest VB/IB allocations, verified on Unlock (d3d9-device);
  COM objects bracketed with guard words (com-memory checkComGuard).
- Ring Buffers: Capture last N WinAPI calls (IDs + timestamps) and memory events (alloc/free, Lock/Unlock, Blt/Flip).
- Corruption Protocol: On fault, log: EIP, fault address, last N calls, ring buffer, full memory map.
- Invariants: No region overlaps; borrowed pointers never point into THUNK_CODE/RESERVED.

3.5 Thunk System Invariants

- Async thunks MUST: (a) set is_jumping=true AND (b) overwrite [ESP] with spinLoopAddress AND
  (c) call scheduler.markThreadAsyncParked(tid, cpu) + preemptionManager.requestImmediateExit().
  (a)+(b) handle the JIT OUT+RET N atomicity bug (v86 may compile both as one block).
  (c) transitions the thread to WAITING so the scheduler skips it and v86 leaves its cycle
  loop immediately — without it v86 honestly JIT-executes JMP $ for a full quantum,
  burning worker CPU. On completion, wakeThreadForAsyncCompletion flips
  WAITING→READY; on the same-thread branch of tryApplyPendingAsyncRestoreAtSafePoint,
  markThreadRunningAfterAsyncWake brings READY→RUNNING before applyAsyncRestoreCpuState.
  _restoreAsyncContext uses info.returnAddr (not [ESP]) since [ESP] was intentionally overwritten.
  Safety net in preemptAtTickBoundary detects RUNNING+eip===spinLoopBase and retro-marks
  (logs SAFETY_NET warn); SEH stubs at spinLoop+2/+4/+0x200 are excluded via strict equality.
- Sync thunks with stackCleanup use manual RET N simulation in _handleSyncResult.
  Thunks that invoke callbacks (e.g. DispatchMessage) MUST set skipStackCheck=true —
  manual RET would overwrite the EIP already set to the WndProc target.
- Virtual time compensation: after sync thunks, credit elapsed wall-clock to
  TimeService.advanceVirtualTime() (gated on a >0.5ms deficit, capped at 16ms per credit).
  Without this, games accelerate because no x86 instructions were generated during the
  thunk (dt starvation).
- lastExpectedEspAfterReturn is set only for sync thunks, never async.

3.6 Thread Safety Rules

- Every code path that switches threads MUST call dispatcher.onThreadSwitch(oldId, newId)
  to save/restore lastExpectedEspAfterReturn per-thread. Missing this causes stale ESP →
  wrong post-return context → stack corruption → #GP.
- CreateThread must NOT call requestSwitch(). New threads are scheduled only at next quantum
  expiry or explicit yield — premature switch causes races before the creator sets up shared state.
- FS base (cpu.segment_offsets[4] = next.tebAddress) must be updated on every context switch.
  This is now CENTRALIZED in the single switch primitive `performSwitch` (all switch paths route
  through it: onThunkComplete and the spin-loop/blocked path in preemptAtTickBoundary). The legacy
  `switchToThread` no longer exists — do not re-introduce a second switch primitive that could drift.
  Characterized by tools/tests/scheduler-state-machine.test.ts (asserts FS base follows the resumed
  thread, alongside FPU/SSE restore + onThreadSwitch).
- Shared-register-file rule: all guest threads run over the single v86 register file, so
  EVERY piece of shared/lazy CPU state MUST be saved on preempt and restored on resume:
  - x87 FPU — CpuContext.fpu, fpu-helper fpuSnapshot/fpuRestore
    (8×F80 + stack_ptr + stack_empty + control/status).
  - SSE — CpuContext.simd, simdSnapshot/simdRestore (mxcsr@824 + reg_xmm@832, 132 bytes —
    8 XMM in 32-bit mode; the next v86 field is current_tsc@960, DON'T widen past 128 xmm
    bytes). v86 implements SSE/SSE2 and we advertise PF_XMMI*_AVAILABLE, so D3DX/CRT/engine
    SIMD all run over it. Save wherever CpuContext.fpu is saved; restore in restoreContext.
  - Lazy EFLAGS — v86 computes arithmetic flags lazily (flags[0] + flags_changed +
    last_op1/last_result/last_op_size); raw flags[0] is stale while flags_changed != 0.
    saveCpuContext must save cpu.get_eflags() (materialized); applyContextState must clear
    cpu.flags_changed[0] = 0 after writing flags (popf/update_eflags semantics).
  Missing any of these ⇒ a preempted thread resumes with another thread's FPU stack /
  XMM+MXCSR / flag source: non-deterministic float garbage (one-frame artifacts, sporadic
  NaN vertices) or a wrong branch/carry → random host-timing-dependent memory corruption.
  This class survives pipeline-level bisects — suspect context switching first.
- Self-restore optimization: if performSwitch picks the same thread, skip restore entirely —
  CPU state is already correct, RET N executes naturally.

3.7 WASM Hypercall Tiers

Four-tier hierarchy — implement new hot paths here before adding JS thunks:
  Tier 1 (1–16):  Time, sync primitives, UI (GetTickCount, CS enter/leave, GetCursorPos, PeekMessage).
  Tier 2 (17–45): FPU/math (_ftol, _CI*, sin/cos/sqrt/pow/ceil/floor and friends).
  Tier 3 (51–62): String/memory (wcscpy/wcslen, memcpy/memset, strcmp/stricmp/memcmp).
  Tier 4:         JS fallback — try_dispatch() returns false → JS handles it.
JS implementations are mandatory fallbacks; never remove them.

3.8 Static-Library HLE — Scope Constraints

The `src/worker/core/hle-lib/` framework (signature detection + JMP-prologue patching +
`resolveAdditionalFunctions`; shipped descriptors live under `hle-lib/libs/`) suits
**stateless or simple-state APIs** — a function whose whole contract is one context struct
argument (zlib-style inflate). It does NOT work for APIs whose setup allocates internal
module controllers: the replacement handler would need those controllers' vtables in place
before returning, and mocking them is hundreds of LoC of version-specific code (confirmed
with libjpeg — `jpeg_create_decompress` wires 6-8 internal controllers, and downstream game
code checks one of those pointers and bails).

For complex-state libraries prefer **inner-loop hooking**: patch pure-compute leaf functions
(IDCT, YCbCr→RGB, Huffman decode) with WASM SIMD implementations that don't touch library
state — reusable, and the guest's own state machine stays intact.

Perf reality check: static-lib HLE can only shave the JS slice of a worker trace (a small
fraction of total time). Only pursue a target when profile data shows it on the hot path.

3.9 Comment Discipline

- Comments explain WHY / non-obvious invariants, not what the code already says. No
  war-stories, no changelog/incident narratives (dates, one-off measured counts, "an
  earlier version did X … root-caused … fixed by Y"), no multi-paragraph blocks.
- No removal tombstones: when you delete code, delete it cleanly — do NOT leave a comment
  saying "X removed / no longer here / used to do Y". The absence speaks for itself.
- Match the comment density of the surrounding code; a one-line note beats a paragraph.

4. Operational Workflow

Stack: TypeScript (Bun/Vite), WebGPU, AudioWorklet, React (Host).

Launching a WGB bundle (a `.wgb` is a store-only ZIP: manifest.json + registry.json + the game
files; see make-wgb/wgb.ts below):
  - Bare emulator + load any bundle by URL: open `?game=dev`, then `window.loadApp('<url>')`.
    Bundles served from `public/` resolve under `/apps/...`; point `public/apps/external-wgb`
    at a local WGB drop-folder (e.g. a symlink), so `window.loadApp('/apps/external-wgb/<name>.wgb')`
    loads a file dropped there. `loadApp` posts `{type:'load_bundle', url}` to the worker.
  - Registered game by id: `?game=<id>` (the host's game registry; `?game=dev` is the special
    bare/no-game id that just exposes `window.loadApp`/`worker`/`dbg`).
  - Local file (no server path): the host UI "Load File..." button → posts `load_bundle {blob}`.
  - Bundle behavior is driven by its manifest (RAM, OS, resolution, registry, `skipVideo`, args).
    Create/patch bundles with `make-wgb` / `wgb.ts` (below) — never hand-edit registry.json.

Debugging workflow — USE THE HARNESS. The AI-agent harness (`src/worker/harness/`, `src/harness/`,
`tools/harness.ts`, `window.__BS__.harness`) wraps the whole "load a game, make it do X, see what
happened" loop in fluent, self-judging verbs. Invoke the `/bringup` skill (`.claude/skills/bringup/`)
for the operational checklist; `bun tools/harness.ts up` does cold-to-ready, then e.g.
`harness().openWgb(..).waitForEvent('dialogShow').click('Play').tickFrames(120).expectSurfaceNonBlack('primary').state([..]).run()`.
Drive the emulator through the project's own CDP harness (`tools/harness.ts` / `window.__BS__.harness`),
NOT a browser MCP — the harness owns the Chrome instance; a second CDP client conflicts with it. Load-bearing facts the harness encodes (and the manual `dbg.*` fallback still needs):
  - Dev: `bun run dev` (:5174 plain HTTP by default — automation needn't clear a self-signed cert;
    `bun run dev:ssl` opts into HTTPS) +
    `bun run dev:logs` (:3001 log server; start it BEFORE streaming). Kill a stale Vite via PowerShell
    `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | ? CommandLine -match 'vite'` (git-bash `pkill` won't kill it).
  - `?game=dev` = the bare emulator exposing `window.loadApp/worker/dbg/__BS__`.
  - Audio: needs a real gesture OR Chrome's `--autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required` (which
    `harness up` sets). Without it AudioContext stays SUSPENDED → SAB play cursor frozen → audio-gated
    logic stalls silently (frames render but the game never advances).
  - SEE pixels via screenshot / `harness shot()` — the canvas is an OffscreenCanvas the main thread
    can't read. A specific guest surface/texture: `dumpSurface`/`textures` (or `__gdibDumpName` →
    GetDIBits PNG → `debug_png_dump` → log server `logs/debug/`).
  - Intros: a bundle's `skipVideo` makes MCI/Bink/Smack complete instantly.
  - ANY non-standard situation (froze / vanished / black frame / unexpected exit / wild EIP) → FIRST
    pull `report()` (CLI: `bun tools/harness.ts report`). One firehose-immune POJO with: CPU regs, the
    module-labelled guest call stack (`backtrace()`), the recent WinAPI ring (last thunks), the
    UNIMPLEMENTED-thunk registry (`stubs()`), the recent LoadLibrary ring (DLL name → handle / why NULL),
    the last MessageBox texts, recent page faults, and threads. The usual root cause of a
    game "gracefully vanishing" is a stub: it calls a vtable slot / export with no JS handler, gets a
    garbage return, and takes an "unsupported → exit(0)" branch — `stubs()` names it (e.g. a graphics-options
    screen → unimplemented `d3d9:CreateCubeTexture` → `exit(0)`) with the guest caller for `re`. A clean
    guest `ExitProcess` (no trap) also auto-logs `[EXIT-TRACE]`, but late teardown can drop it — prefer
    `breakOnApi('kernel32:ExitProcess')` (its snapshot carries `backtrace`+`lastThunks`) or `report()`.
  - Logs (megabytes/sec): don't grep the firehose — `logStats` (template-dedup summary), `watchLog(/re/)`
    (signal→event), `markLog`/`logsSince` (windows); the fault snapshot carries the log-ring tail. The
    log server (:3001) is the durable archive tier, managed by `harness up`.
  - RE the guest: the warm RE service (`tools/re/`, §14) — `re decompile/resolve/exportSymbolMap`
    (Ghidra headless writes to a file; stdout is lost). `re resolve <eip> --base <liveBase>` closes the
    wild-EIP→function loop; `re exportSymbolMap` feeds `loadSymbols`/`breakOnSymbol`.
  - Diagnostic discipline: confirm with DATA (a dump / a logged value), not reasoning about GDI/DC or
    vtable topology — the canvas-vs-selected-bitmap distinction and multi-DC composites mis-model easily.

Self-improvement (bake capability, don't relearn it): when you CLOSE a bug, ask what reusable harness
verb / `re` command would have shortened it — and ADD it. While debugging, if the existing verbs are
insufficient, EXTEND the harness (a new `cmds/*` module) rather than write a throwaway `cdp-*` probe;
the harness is the durable home for diagnostic capability, one-off probes are a smell. After fixing, keep
the reusable tool and delete the probe.

Quality Gate (mandatory order):
  1. bun tools/generate-index.ts
  2. bun tools/validate-signatures.ts
  3. bun tools/validate-struct-offsets.ts
  4. bun run typecheck

Tooling:
  - analyze-trace.ts  — Chrome profiler trace → self/total time per thread, WASM breakdown
    (JIT blocks, io_port_write32, hypercall annotation), 2s-bucket timeline. Primary perf tool.
    Usage: bun tools/analyze-trace.ts <trace.json.gz> [--top N] [--thread worker|main|audio]
    Interpreting output: io_port_write32 in top → heavy thunks; jit_find_cache_entry → indirect
    jump pressure; wasm% > 85% → CPU bound in guest code, not JS overhead.
  - make-wgb — HIGH-LEVEL bundle creator. Takes a raw game dir + CLI flags, generates
    manifest.json + registry.json via JSON.stringify (guarantees correct \\ escaping),
    packs everything in one step. Use this instead of wgb.ts for creating new bundles.
    Usage: bun tools/make-wgb.ts <game-dir> <output.wgb> [flags: name/exe/resolution/bpp/ram/
           os/registry/args/skip-video/codepages/lcid/create-dirs — see the tool header].
    CRITICAL: Never write registry.json manually with shell heredocs or Write tool —
    backslash escaping is unreliable across editors/linters/hooks. Always use make-wgb
    or JSON.stringify in a script.
    EMPTY-DIR GOTCHA (a `.wgb` is a store-only ZIP — a ZIP has NO entry for an empty
    directory): an installer-created empty folder (e.g. `user\rosters`, `user\save\photos`)
    vanishes on pack, and the game's fopen("wb") into it then fails (Windows fopen does not
    mkdir parents) → silent, brutal-to-diagnose bugs (game writes nothing / a menu resets in
    a loop). make-wgb AUTO-DETECTS empty dirs in the source and adds them to
    `emulator.createDirs`; the worker recreates them at boot (ensureDirTreeSync/mkdir -p). If
    you pack from a source that already lost the empty dirs, pass `--create-dirs
    "user\rosters,user\save\photos"` explicitly. The manifest field is the sanctioned
    fix — it replicates the installer's on-disk layout, NOT a per-game hack.
  - wgb.ts — Unified WGB archive tool (list/cat/extract/replace/manifest/set-manifest/patch-manifest).
    Replaces pack-wgb, repack-wgb, extract-wgb, list-wgb. Store-only ZIP, own parser.
    Usage: bun tools/wgb.ts <command> <archive.wgb> [args...]
    Aliases: ls=list, x=extract, pm=patch-manifest.
  - patch-wgb-vram — VRAM override patcher for existing bundles.
  - build-ffmpeg-decoder/ — separate WASM build; rebuild only when decoder_api.c or build.sh change.

Archive / installer formats — USE OUR OWN READERS, never `apt install` a third-party unpacker.
  We ship a self-hosted, browser-safe format stack in `packages/formats/src/` (reusable core parsers)
  with thin Bun CLI wrappers in `tools/`. Reach for these BEFORE 7-Zip/cabextract/unshield/innoextract
  or a hand-rolled one-off parser — the whole point is that `.wgb` bring-up needs no external native tool
  and works headless (CI, cron, no root). Coverage:
    - zip/          — store + deflate ZIP (also the `.wgb` container).
    - cab/          — Microsoft Cabinet (`MSCF`), incl. one APPENDED to a Win32 SFX stub
                      ("PackageForTheWeb" self-extractors). CLI: `tools/cab-extract.ts`. NONE + MSZIP.
    - installshield/— InstallShield Cabinet (`ISc(`, v5 AND v6+) — the `data1.hdr` + `data{N}.cab`
                      layout behind most 1998–2003 game installers. Handles chunked raw-deflate,
                      de-obfuscation, LINK_PREV dedup, volume-split files, MD5 verify.
                      CLI: `tools/unshield-extract.ts <data1.hdr> <out> [--list]`.
                      (NOT the same as MSCF — 7-Zip/cabextract cannot read `ISc(`.)
    - inno/         — Inno Setup headers (LZMA1/2 via the Rust WASM backend). CLI: `tools/inno-inspect.ts`;
                      end-to-end GOG installer → bundle: `tools/gog-to-wgb.ts`.
    - freearc/      — FreeArc (`.arc`, srep+LZMA) used by some repacks.
    - iso/          — ISO9660 + BIN/CUE disc images. CLI: `tools/iso-to-wgb.ts`; `tools/bin2iso.ts`.
    - unpack/       — shared native codec backend (LZMA1/LZMA2/srep) built from the Rust crate
                      `tools/build-unpack-streaming` → `public/unpack-streaming.wasm`, plus the
                      dependency-free primitives (RandomAccessSource, Crc32/Md5/Sha1) every reader uses.
  A WinZip-SFX/PFTW `.exe` is a ZIP/CAB wrapping an InstallShield disk set: unwrap the outer archive
  (zip/cab), then run `unshield-extract` on the inner `data1.hdr` to get the real game files.
  New container/compression not covered above? EXTEND this stack (a new `formats/<fmt>` core + a CLI
  wrapper), don't shell out to a system binary — same discipline as extending the harness: each new
  invariant we hit becomes a durable, self-hosted capability, not an external dependency or a throwaway.
  The `/repack` skill (`.claude/skills/repack/`) operationalizes the whole installer→`.wgb` flow
  (which reader for which container, make-wgb usage, and the empty-directory pitfall) — invoke it when
  packing/repacking a bundle or diagnosing one that boots but won't save.

v86 core (vendor/v86/ — a git submodule; clone with --recurse-submodules):
  - Use bracket notation (this["prop"]) for all properties accessed from TS code.
    Closure Compiler advanced optimizations rename dot-notation properties → silent runtime breakage.
  - Build: vendor/v86/build-wasm.sh. Generated Rust files (jit.rs etc.) are not in git —
    run gen scripts before cargo build.

Memory Validation: Use address-guard.ts / mem-accessor.ts checks in debug builds;
  never bypass in production without explicit rationale.
