# The automation harness

Bringing up a game — load it, make it reach a menu or level, and figure out why it froze or
rendered black — is the core debugging loop. BottleShip wraps that loop in an **automation
harness**: fluent, self-judging verbs you can drive from the command line or the browser
console, plus structured introspection that survives the multi-megabyte-per-second log
firehose.

## Running it

```bash
bun tools/harness.ts up        # cold start: launch Chrome + dev servers, reach "ready"
bun tools/harness.ts report    # one structured snapshot of the whole machine state
bun tools/harness.ts shot      # screenshot the (offscreen) canvas
```

`up` starts the dev server and a log server, launches Chrome with the flags the engine needs
(including an autoplay policy so audio unlocks without a user gesture — audio-gated games stall
silently otherwise), opens the bare emulator page, and waits until everything is healthy.

In the browser console the same capability is on `window.__BS__.harness`.

## Driving a game

The harness exposes a fluent, self-checking DSL. A bring-up script reads like the steps a human
would take, and each verb asserts its own success:

```js
harness()
  .openWgb('/apps/mygame.wgb')
  .waitForEvent('dialogShow')
  .click('Play')
  .tickFrames(120)
  .expectSurfaceNonBlack('primary')
  .run()
```

Verbs cover loading bundles, waiting for events, synthetic input (clicks, keys), advancing
frames, and asserting on rendered surfaces and engine state.

## Seeing what happened

The canvas is an `OffscreenCanvas` the main thread can't read directly, and the guest generates
far too much log output to grep. So the harness gives you structured views instead:

- **`report()`** — the firehose-immune snapshot. One plain object with CPU registers, the
  module-labelled guest call stack, the recent WinAPI call ring (the last thunks that ran), the
  **unimplemented-stub registry**, the recent `LoadLibrary` ring (DLL name → handle, or why it
  came back NULL), the last `MessageBox` captions/texts, recent page faults, and thread states.
  This is the first thing to pull for *any* non-standard situation (froze / vanished / black
  frame / wild EIP).
- **Stub registry.** The usual reason a game "gracefully vanishes" is that it called an export
  or vtable slot with no implementation, got a garbage return, and took an "unsupported → exit"
  branch. The stub registry names exactly which unimplemented call it was and who called it.
- **Log tools.** Instead of grepping the stream: a template-deduped summary
  (`the same stub called 10,000× becomes one ranked row`), signal→event watchers that block
  until a specific message appears, and time-windowed captures. A durable log-server archives
  the stream to disk.
- **Surfaces & textures.** Dump a specific guest surface or texture to a PNG when a screenshot
  of the composited canvas isn't enough.

## Reverse-engineering the guest

For understanding the guest binary itself, a warm RE service (Ghidra headless behind an HTTP
daemon) is available through `tools/re/` — decompile a function, resolve a live EIP back to a
function name, or export a symbol map to load breakpoints from.

## Diagnostic discipline

Confirm with **data** — a dump, a logged value, a `report()` — not by reasoning about how you
think GDI or a vtable is laid out. Multi-DC composites, the canvas-vs-selected-bitmap
distinction, and COM vtable topology all mis-model easily; a dump settles it.
